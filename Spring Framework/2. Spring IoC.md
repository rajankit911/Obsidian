#spring-ioc 

One of the main features of the Spring framework is the **IoC (Inversion of Control) container**. The **Spring IoC container** is responsible for managing the objects of an application. It uses dependency injection to achieve inversion of control.

-	The **Spring IoC container** is at the core of the Spring Framework.

-	The Spring IoC container will
	-	create the objects
	-	configure them
	-	wire them together (assemble them)
	-	manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction

-	The Spring IoC Container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading [[Configuration Metadata]].

-	The Spring IoC container uses dependency injection (DI) to manage the components that make up an application.

-	In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC _container_ are called _beans_. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the _dependencies_ among them, are reflected in the _configuration metadata_ used by a container.
