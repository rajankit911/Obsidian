What are event-driven architectures (EDAs) and how do they fit into microservices?

Hide Answer

EDAs are systems where services communicate through the exchange of events rather than direct request-response interactions. An event can represent a significant occurrence or state change within a service. It is typically published to a message broker or event bus. Other services, which have an interest in such events, can subscribe to the event and react accordingly.

In microservices, EDA plays a crucial role in achieving loose coupling between services. It enables better scalability as services only need to respond to events they subscribe to. It enhances system resilience as services can continue to function even if some are temporarily unavailable.

Event-driven architectures also promote event sourcing and eventual consistency, enabling better handling of complex business processes and data synchronization.
