The idea is to use these strategies in combination with the write-behind approach to optimize the writing process and reduce workload on the database by handling write spikes more gracefully.

## Using rate limiting

When a lot of write requests come in all at once, it can overwhelm the database. To avoid this, we can use rate limiting in a write-behind cache to put a cap on the number of write requests the database can handle per second or per minute.
This will spread out the write workload over a more extended period, ensuring a steady flow of writes to the database rather than a sudden surge during peak periods. It will give the database enough time to catch up and process the write requests without getting overloaded.

## Using batching and coalescing technique

We can use batching and coalescing techniques in the write-behind cache to reduce the number of write requests. Batching combines multiple write operations into a single write while coalescing consolidates multiple updates on the same data into a single update.
This means that instead of immediately writing each change to the database, the cache can group them and write them as a single operation. Consequently, this will decrease the overall number of database writes, effectively reducing the load on the database. The good thing is: It will also save costs when the database provider charges based on the number of requests made.

## Using time shifting

Databases can experience "rush hours" when lots of data are being written or modified simultaneously. So time shifting is an idea to strategically move the process of writing data to less busy times or time intervals other than peak usage times. This will allow the system to avoid becoming overwhelmed during high contention periods.
