Life Cycle of Bean is easy to understand. When a bean is instantiated, it may be required to perform some initialization to get it into a usable state. Similarly, when the bean is no longer required and is remove from the container, some cleanup may be required.

You can use `init-method` and `destory-method` as attribute in bean configuration file for bean to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction.

- **Initialization** - `org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean` Interface contains one single method `void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception`
- **Destruction** - `org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean` Interface contains one single method `void destroy() throws Exception`
