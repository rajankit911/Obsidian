# Immutability in Functional Programming

Immutability is a key principle in functional programming, which refers to the practice of creating objects that cannot be changed once they are created.

- Immutable objects are thread-safe and can help prevent bugs that are caused by mutable state.
- Immutable objects can also improve the performance and scalability of applications by allowing for better optimizations and parallel processing.
- In functional programming, new immutable objects are created by applying functions to existing immutable objects, rather than modifying them in place.

# HashMap Internals and Hash Collisions

- A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in an array using a hash function to map keys to array indices.
- Hash collisions occur when two different keys are hashed to the same array index, causing the hash map to store multiple key-value pairs at the same index.
- In the event of a hash collision, hash maps typically use separate chaining or open addressing to store multiple key-value pairs at the same index.
- Separate chaining uses a linked list to store multiple key-value pairs at the same index, while open addressing uses a probing algorithm to find an alternative array index to store the key-value pair.

# Importance of Forward and Reverse Proxies in Serverless Environments

- Forward and reverse proxies are middleware that can be used to manage and secure serverless environments.
- Forward proxies act as intermediaries between clients and servers, forwarding requests from clients to servers and returning responses to clients.
- Reverse proxies act as intermediaries between servers and the internet, routing incoming requests to the appropriate server and returning responses to clients.
- Forward and reverse proxies can be used to improve performance, security, and scalability in serverless environments.

# Java Functional Programming

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens, immutability, and the avoidance of side effects.
- Java supports functional programming through features such as lambda expressions, method references, and streams.

# Limitations of AWS Lambda Concurrency, Memory, and CPU Allocation

- AWS Lambda imposes some limitations on concurrency, memory, and CPU allocation, such as:
    - Concurrency: The number of concurrent Lambda functions that can run per region
    - Memory: The amount of memory allocated to each Lambda function instance
    - CPU: The amount of CPU power allocated to each Lambda function instance in proportion to the memory allocation

# Saga Pattern: Distributed Transaction Handling

- The Saga pattern is a way to handle distributed transactions in a microservices architecture.
- It involves breaking down a distributed transaction into a sequence of local transactions, each of which can be rolled back or compensated in the event of a failure.

# Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

- Functional interfaces are interfaces in Java that contain only one abstract method.
- Lambda expressions are shorthand syntax for defining anonymous functions that can be used as arguments or return values.
- Java 8 and later versions introduced functional interfaces and lambda expressions to support functional programming.

# Unit Testing and Integration Testing: Ensuring Code Quality and Functionality

- Unit testing and integration testing are techniques for verifying the correctness and functionality of code.
- Unit testing involves testing individual units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation.
- Integration testing involves testing the interactions and dependencies between units of code, such as modules or components.

# Algorithm Complexity Analysis

- Algorithm complexity analysis is the process of determining the computational complexity of an algorithm, i.e., the amount of time and space it requires to run as a function of the input size.
- Algorithm complexity is often expressed using big





#   
Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

Functional interfaces are interfaces in Java that have only one abstract method. They can have any number of default, static methods. Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be used to create instances of functional interfaces.

Example:

```java
Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
```

In the above example, `Function<Integer, Integer>` is a functional interface and `x -> x * x` is a lambda expression that can be used to create an instance of the functional interface.

Lambda expressions are useful in functional programming and can help make code more concise and expressive. They are commonly used with the Java Streams API for functional-style operations on collections.

Note: It is important to understand the concept of functional interfaces and lambda expressions when working with Java and AWS, as they are often used in modern application development and automation tools.

Criteria for Applying Binary Search:

- The array or list should be non-empty and sorted in ascending order.
- The element to be searched should be comparable to the elements in the array or list.

HashMap Internals and Hash Collisions:

- A HashMap stores key-value pairs in an array of linked lists, where each list represents a "bucket" for key-value pairs with the same hash code.
- Hash collisions occur when two keys have the same hash code, resulting in both key-value pairs being stored in the same bucket.
- There are two common methods to handle hash collisions: chaining and open addressing. In chaining, each bucket is a linked list, allowing many key-value pairs to be stored in the same bucket. In open addressing, the algorithm seeks a different bucket if a collision occurs.

Importance of forward and reverse proxies in serverless environments:

- Forward proxies can cache responses, reducing the load on serverless functions.
- Reverse proxies can load balance and route requests to serverless functions, improving availability and scalability.
- Both types of proxies can perform authentication and authorization, protecting serverless functions from unauthorized access.

# Cloud Auto Scaling: Efficient Resource Management

Auto scaling in cloud computing is the process of automatically scaling resources up or down in response to changing workloads. This allows for efficient resource management and cost savings.

## Key Concepts

- **Horizontal scaling:** adding or removing instances of a resource (such as virtual machines)
- **Vertical scaling:** increasing or decreasing the size of a resource (such as adding more CPU or memory)
- **Auto scaling policy:** a set of rules that determine when and how resources should be scaled

## Importance of Auto Scaling

- Allows for efficient resource utilization, only using what is needed
- Can automatically handle spikes in traffic or usage
- Can save costs by scaling down resources during periods of low demand

## Implementing Auto Scaling

- Different cloud providers have their own auto scaling solutions (e.g. AWS Auto Scaling, Azure Autoscale, Google Cloud Autoscaler)
- Configuring auto scaling typically involves setting up an auto scaling group and creating a launch configuration that specifies the instance details

## Considerations

- Careful monitoring and management of auto scaling is important to ensure efficiency and cost savings
- Auto scaling policies should be tested and fine-tuned to find the optimal balance between performance and cost
