Difference between dependency injection and dependency inversion  
  
Dependency Injection (DI) and Dependency Inversion (DI) are concepts in software engineering, particularly in object-oriented design and programming. Although they are related and often used together, they address different aspects of managing dependencies within a software system.  
  
1. Dependency Injection (DI):  
- Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) in which the dependencies of a class (i.e., the objects it depends on to perform its tasks) are provided from the outside rather than created internally.  
- In DI, the dependencies are "injected" into the class through constructor injection, method injection, or property injection.  
- The main goal of DI is to make classes more reusable, testable, and easier to maintain by decoupling them from their dependencies and promoting loose coupling.  
  
2. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):  
- Dependency Inversion is a principle of object-oriented design, part of the SOLID principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).  
- DIP states that high-level modules (e.g., business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., concrete implementations of dependencies). Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).  
- Additionally, DIP states that abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.  
- By adhering to DIP, you promote decoupling between modules, making the system more flexible, maintainable, and easier to change.  
  
In essence, Dependency Injection is a technique for implementing Dependency Inversion. DI is the practice of providing dependencies to a class, while DIP is a principle that guides the design of classes and their relationships, promoting decoupling through abstraction.
